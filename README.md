# List-maker
 Simple python script to create/edit/save lists. May add more features later.
 Any created lists are stored within a dictionary as the "value" in the key:value pair. Each list is associated with a name, which will is the "key" in the key:value pair. I have used a dictionary as it is the only way I could currently come up with a way to store several lists without making each one a global variable.
